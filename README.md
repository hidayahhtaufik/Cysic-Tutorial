# Cysic Incentivized Testnet Phase 1 Verifier Setup

This guide will walk you through setting up a verifier node for the Cysic Incentivized Testnet Phase 1. Follow the instructions below to configure and run the verifier on your VPS.

## Prerequisites

- A VPS (Virtual Private Server) with Linux OS
- A registered Cysic Testnet account (Whitelist required)
- An EVM-compatible wallet address for reward claims

## Steps to Set Up the Verifier

1. **Download the setup script and set permissions:**

   First, you'll need to download the setup script from the repository and make it executable.

   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hidayahhtaufik/Cysic-Verifier-Tutorial/master/run.sh && chmod +x run.sh

2. **Run the setup script:**

    Execute the script by providing your EVM wallet address as an argument. This address will be used to claim rewards.

    ```bash
   sh run.sh <YOUR-EVM-ADDRESS>

2. **Wait for the verifier to start:**

    After running the script, the verifier will start, and it may take 15â€“20 minutes for the block process to begin. Make sure to monitor the logs to ensure everything is running smoothly.
